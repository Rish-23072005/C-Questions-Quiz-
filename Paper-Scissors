Level 3 : Question-2
Problem Statement:

In the heat of the summer, two friends, Amrit and Ravi, decide to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to pass the time. Each player makes a decision: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winner is determined based on the classic rules: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.

Input Format:

The first line contains the name of the first player (Amrit).
The second line contains the name of the second player (Ravi).
The third line contains the decision of Amrit (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
The fourth line contains the decision of Ravi (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Constraints:

The length of the player names and decisions is greater than 0.
Output Format:

Print a single line indicating the winner. If Amrit wins, print “Amrit Wins”; if Ravi wins, print “Ravi Wins”.
Note: After determining the winner, the program should ask if the players want to start a new game.
